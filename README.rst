Contains the following modules
------------------------------
See the documentation link (above) and module documentation for detailed docs.

changed
~~~~~~~
Code to check if directory contents have changed since last check.

listfiles
~~~~~~~~~
Yield (digest, fname) tuples for all interesting files
in `dirname`.  The file names are relative to `curdir`
unless otherwise specified.

path
~~~~
"Poor man's pathlib".  Object-oriented wrapper around `os.path` and
friends.  Similar to the Python 3 `pathlib`, however paths are
`str` subclasses and thus much easier to use in an environment
where `os.path` calls are interspersed with object-oriented code.

pfind
~~~~~
Find directory where a file is located by walking up parent directories.

which
~~~~~
Functions for finding executable files on the path.
